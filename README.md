**Getting Started**

1.  HTTP, helps you and me/ By defining how clients and servers speak/Imagine ordering food/not speaking the language/safe to say you might not get what you wanted to eat/ HTTP translates from browser to server/ So now you get what you really ordered/ It's a win for everyone thanks to HTTP and the translation between client and server/

2.  Stages happen for a browser to display a document.  Has to load the HTML into a DOM, or CPU memory, then the browser you are using gets the resources from the HTML .  The CSS and browser then play nice and sort all the rules setup.  It is then laid out or rendered.

3. Images in website-  you can find the image you want by visting google images. 

4. Strings are created by adding a quote that surronds the value.   Numbers are valued without quotes.
